This mod is kinda a hybrid of a personal playground for myself and also a general pack mod for a mod pack I'm making by the same name. Currently I'm working on adding an alcohol system because I thought it would be fun.

I've got some mixins in here to allow CustomModelData NBT tags to transfer across use cases for potions, this will be expanded upon and used to make a bottle customization system for use with potions and alcohol.
